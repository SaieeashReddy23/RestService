# RestService
data is recieved in json format for a http call

# Difference betweeen a RestController and Controller
*For a normal controller it returns a view page but for RestController it returns an Object.
*The object is automatically converted into JSON using jackson library.
*Normal controller with a Response body is nothing but a RestController.
